/* 
HOW TO MANAGE PROMO CODES:

1. Adding a new code:
   - Copy an existing code object
   - Change the code, credits, and description
   - Set isActive to true/false as needed

2. Editing a code:
   - Find the code in the PROMO_CODES array
   - Modify any of its properties
   - Save the file

3. Disabling a code:
   - Set isActive to false
   - The code will remain in the list but won't be redeemable

4. Best practices:
   - Use uppercase for codes
   - Keep descriptions clear and concise
   - Use meaningful code names
   - Set reasonable credit amounts
   - Comment your codes for better organization
